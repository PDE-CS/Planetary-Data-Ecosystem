# Planetary-Data-Ecosystem

1.3. IRB Core Values

During the course of its activities the IRB developed a set of core values that encapsulate our
overarching vision:

● First, do no harm: Avoid the law of unintended consequences.

● FAIR: Facilitate participation in the PDE by adhering to FAIR data principles of Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.

● Open: Advocate open science practices, including open access, open data, open code, open
software/tools, and others.

● Collaborative: Encourage international collaboration. Welcome new participants from both
inside and outside the professional space exploration community.

● Effective: Provide timely, useful support to user communities, especially data producers.

● Practical: Pursuit of ideal solutions may sometimes leave the Ecosystem with no solution at all
rather than a solution that is sufficient.

It is with this shared spirit that we offer the findings and recommendations in this report.
